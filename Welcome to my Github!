About me:

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Hoang and I'm an analyst at Dell Technologies with a background in Quantitative Economics and Operations Management. Currently, I'm pursuing an MS in Analytics
at Georgia Tech. Data is my passion, and I have leveraged Python in my personal projects for ARIMA time-series predictions, assess exogenous factors in SARIMAX models, or automate 
processes in my work. I'm proficient in SQL for Data Lake access and establishing data pipelines to visualize more than a million rows of manufacturing data for management. 
I'm excited to meet new people in the industry and explore potential job opportunities!
