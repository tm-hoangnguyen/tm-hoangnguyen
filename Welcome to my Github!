About me:

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Hoang and I'm an analyst at Dell Technologies with a background in Quantitative Economics and Operations Management. Currently, I'm pursuing an MS in Analytics at Georgia Tech. My passion is data, and I have leveraged Python in my personal projects for ARIMA time-series predictions, assess exogenous factors in SARIMAX models, or automate processes in my work. I'm also proficient in SQL to access Data Lake through DBeaver and establish data pipelines to visualize more than a million rows of manufacturing data in PowerBI for management reporting. Creating this github account, I'm very excited to have a chance to meet and learn from experts in the industry and explore potential job opportunities!
